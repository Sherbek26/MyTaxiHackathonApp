Task Review
Challenges Faced
During the course of this task, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow both personally and professionally. Some of the main challenges included:

[Challenge 1]: Accuracy and Performance of Location Updates
Challenge: Achieving high accuracy in location updates while maintaining performance can be difficult. Frequent location updates may lead to performance issues or excessive battery drain.
Solution: Optimize location request intervals and accuracy settings based on the use case. Use the FusedLocationProviderClient to balance accuracy and battery consumption.
[Challenge 2]: Foreground Service Management
Challenge: Managing a foreground service to continually track user location and update the database can be complex. Properly handling service lifecycle and ensuring it runs consistently without being killed by the system are critical.
Solution: Implement proper foreground service notification and lifecycle management. Ensure that the service handles interruptions and restarts gracefully.
[Challenge 3]: Synchronization Between Location Updates and Database
Challenge: Ensuring that every new location update is correctly and efficiently added to the Room database while avoiding duplicate entries and managing potential conflicts.
Solution: Implement a robust mechanism to check for duplicate entries based on unique location identifiers (like timestamps or geohashes). Use transactions in Room to maintain data integrity.
[Challenge 4]: Integration with Mapbox
Challenge: Properly integrating and updating the Mapbox map view with the latest user location and ensuring that the map reflects the most recent data accurately.
Solution: Implement efficient map update mechanisms and ensure that location updates are applied to the map view in a performant manner. Use Mapbox's SDK features to handle map updates smoothly.
